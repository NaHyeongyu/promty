# Agent Context bridge

Promty exposes the existing compiled Project Memory to coding agents without adding a new
storage model or changing the capture pipeline.

## CLI

After production setup, run this inside a captured repository:

```bash
npx promty-collector@latest context --profile prod
npx promty-collector@latest context --profile prod --format json
```

The CLI derives the same deterministic project UUID used by event capture. Use
`--project-id <uuid>` only when the working directory cannot identify the repository.
For local development, replace `--profile prod` with `--profile dev`.

## MCP

Configure an MCP client to start the following stdio server:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "promty-collector@latest", "mcp", "--profile", "prod"]
}
```

It publishes two read-only tools:

- `get_project_context` returns the latest approved Project Memory as Markdown plus structured
  JSON. It accepts optional `cwd`, `project_id`, and `format` arguments.
- `search_project_context` searches approved memory nodes and their safe file references. It
  requires `query` and accepts optional `cwd`, `project_id`, `limit` (1-20), and `format`
  arguments. Results include recorded relationship provenance so an agent can distinguish saved
  evidence from an inferred relationship.

## API and security

`GET /api/agent/projects/{project_id}/context` accepts only an active, user-owned collector
token. It intentionally rejects the global ingest token and anonymous ingest mode. Project
ownership is checked before private memory is returned.

`GET /api/agent/projects/{project_id}/context/search` uses the same owner-scoped collector token
boundary. It never returns raw prompts, model responses, patch bodies, or unreviewed memory. File
nodes expose only paths and safe change statistics derived from the approved Project Memory.
